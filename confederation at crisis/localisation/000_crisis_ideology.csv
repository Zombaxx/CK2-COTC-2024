eternal_way_DESC;"§Y"I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge, and the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed."\n - The Lord, Bhagavad Gita§!\n\nThe Eternal Way is descended from the Hindu tradition of Sol, but has significantly diverged from it over the centuries. The religion in its current form developed among the descendants of the first settlers of the Veil Nebula, known as the Duuryaatri (or "Far-Travellers"). The faith is still very much centered around that region, with many of its holiest sites being located there. Piety and especially Tradition are very important to its adherents, which may explain why many Eternal Way rulers adopt an almost Feudal type of government.\n;La Voie Éternelle;Der Ewige Weg;;El Camino Eterno;;;;;;;;;x
