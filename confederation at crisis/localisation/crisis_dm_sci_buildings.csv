tp_security_q_1;Security;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_1_desc;Security stations provide basic defenses for the whole settlement against raids or attacks when the other lines of defense have fallen.  These can range from a few simple stations in the main outpost, to a large network of launch bases and barracks scattered all over the planet, moons, or station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_2;Security;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_2_desc;Expanding the home guard lets us crew more defense vessels. By simplifying many of the job requirements for the support staff, we can use these part time soldiers to free up more professionals to crew ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_3;Security;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_3_desc;Retired veterans, washouts and cripples are a good source of knowledge for our reserve. While in most cases they lack the ability to materially contribute, their knowledge and experience helps deal with the growing pains of an expanding command and makes it possible for our pilots to be more than cannon fodder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_4;Security;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_4_desc;The facilities increase in size lets us maintain more models and we are now deploying a few top of the line versions scattered among the rest. By themselves they are not enough to change battles, but the uncertainty they generate is an effective force multiplier forcing the enemy to turn away from what could be potentially superior enemy and spend more ammunition to insure they achieve a kill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_5;Security;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_security_q_5_desc;The reserve is large enough that it can maintain more specialized equipment- high quality sensors, different munition choices, flight configurations, etc. Being able to have better gear as well as more options lets us punch on a more equal level and the ability to do customization at last provides a niche the reserves are better at than the regulars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

tp_archive_q_1;Archive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_archive_q_1_desc;A modern form of the library, a huge archive of digital storage devices that keep humanity's knowledge safe.  Sometimes these places also have physical copies of particularly important or prestigious works.  Practically, these facilities are a great place for someone to do research on their ideologies and prepare for special actions related to that ideology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_archive_q_2;Archive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_archive_q_2_desc;When storing valuable physical artifacts one of the most important considerations is that you have the actual artifact in question and not a fake. Spending on exhaustive historical research may seem mostly fruitless, but it saves use the worry of finding that we have a lemon on our hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_archive_q_3;Archive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_archive_q_3_desc;"Valuable artifact" is a magnet for thieves. Rather than shutting the achieves to everyone we've invested in a full suite of security measures. A bit paranoid, but better safe than sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_archive_q_4;Archive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_archive_q_4_desc;Physical back ups, duplicates and fortified storage units may look excessive, but in a universe with space pirates they are practical measures. One can never be too careful, although there are complaints about the trap network we've installed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_archive_q_5;Archive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_archive_q_5_desc;We've secured our storage facilities, but there isn't to much of a point to them if people can't use them. Not just the research staff, but local worlds now have access to many of the records and can now browse the stacks and examine the physical copies. The main issue was making entry and exist smooth without interrupting the security, maintenance or temperature control systems, but with a little bit of effort we've managed to make sure none of them overlap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_archive_q_6;Archive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_archive_q_6_desc;Finding new artifacts to add to the collection is a never ending task and we've commission a group dedicated entirely to that goal.

tp_administrative_sector_q_1;Administrative Sector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_1_desc;Scientific settlements often serve the dual purpose of advancing human knowledge, as well as effectively managing interplanet activities and governments.  Investing in improving this administrative ability is a great way to directly increase your political capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_2;Administrative Sector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_2_desc;One of the easiest methods to improve governance- or at least its appearance- is to promote feedback and respond to it. Finding the most common lines of questioning and setting up an automated system to answer them lets citizens have a feeling of being more involved without diverting manpower from the research staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_3;Administrative Sector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_3_desc;Sometimes the questions we receive are actually novel. Being able to sift through the trash and find the diamonds in the rough not only is a boon to our ability to respond to new challenges, but lets citizens have concrete examples of their feedback leading to change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_4;Administrative Sector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_4_desc;There are always important individuals who have disproportionate influence and whose lead the masses tend to follow.

tp_administrative_sector_q_5;Administrative Sector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_5_desc;Making a multisystem network to coordinate different star systems promises an increase an efficiency; the only fly in the ointment is that people tend to be unwilling to make sacrifices for the good of the whole. By staggering the costs we can avoid any issues with political opposition crystalizing while at the same time getting the political benefits of further centralization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_6;Administrative Sector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_6_desc;Small scale political issues are eternal. While not really relevant on the scale the state normally operates taking the case load for smaller municipalities, school districts and the like provides another connection to the common citizen and increases our ability to mobilize them politically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_7;Administrative Sector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_7_desc;Acquiring new administrative insights and continuing to expand our programs requires investigating how other methods work and applying the best to our own.

tp_administrative_sector_q_8;Administrative Sector;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_administrative_sector_q_8_desc;Given the sheer number of connections the administrative sector now has, we can now enact large scale changes through small adjustments at specific points in society. Less blatant than astroturfing this provides us with the ability to shift public opinion to match our goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_1;Private Education Complex;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_1_desc;One of the best ways for a scientific settlement to gain additional funds is to offer private education for upper class members of society and train the local residents.  The infrastructure needed to offer this service are living quarters for foreign students, classrooms, lecture halls, and student labs.  There is a big upfront investment, but they'll pay for themselves in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_2;Private Education Complex;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_2_desc;One of the unpleasant realities of interstellar colonization is that different worlds have different days, different color skies, different smells, different everything. Instead of just sticking to galactic standard, we can make our learning facilities morphic and have them match the students native environment. Aside from being more comfortable, it makes learning occur faster and allows us to process applicants faster.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_3;Private Education Complex;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_3_desc;As the knowledge of worlds outside Earth advance, it becomes easier to make students more adapted to the local realities, gardens for the students, more confortable living quarters, better protective suits for expeditions, all those are expensive but enable better education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_4;Private Education Complex;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_4_desc;One of the reasons people come to these facilities is to meet important scientists and feel that they have a hang on the current state of fields they are interested in. To that end we've made it so they have substantially more time to interact with the facilities staff and see them at work. To compensate for this and to avoid work grinding to a halt we've been forced to implement a significant number of improvements to the intern system. Having the students take some of the drudge work load by making it easy to learn the requirements alleviates the total loss of productivity we'd otherwise face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_5;Private Education Complex;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_5_desc;Turning a profit while terraforming the students living quarters is quite hard, so now we created a more robust alumni outreach, offering further training and keeping our graduates knowledge up to date, we raise our status and the premium we can command for schooling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_6;Private Education Complex;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_classrooms_q_6_desc;Standing out from the pack is always hard, so we've been forced to do something truly unique. Whether it is a facility that constantly reshapes itself, engineering the local ecosystem to provide for the students or bringing back extinct animals to allow dinosaur jousting, we've insured the learning environment here is distinct and its name is recognized throughout the galaxy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_1;Exotic Materials Research;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_1_desc;As humans explore more and more of the galaxy, new and exciting compounds are also being discovered.  One of the most exciting (and explosive) of the emerging fields is working on new exotic materials.  Large bombing ranges and delivery ships are of course necessary to test the new materials that can then be sold for mining and property development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_2;Exotic Materials Research;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_2_desc;More inherently dangerous materials (of the self replicating variety) offer a higher payoff for the facility to study, but require a commensurate investment in infrastructure and ships in order to prevent a grey goo scenario.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_3;Exotic Materials Research;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_3_desc;The next step on the ladder of exceptionally dangerous science, nuclear reactions and radioactive products are being studied here. While space is an effective insulator in containing the blast waves, care has to be undertaken in hardening the bomber craft against constant exposure due to increased levels of radiation. The most effective solution has been to increase the size of the testing fleet and schedule preventative maintenance at a higher tempo. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_4;Exotic Materials Research;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_4_desc;Antimatter is the next big field of research. Packing the highest energy density of anything imaginable it offers huge potential benefits as well as requiring containment systems more through than anything previously devised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_5;Exotic Materials Research;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_exotic_research_q_5_desc;Sometimes sheer firepower isn't enough and in those cases you need something else. Something like miniature black holes. The amount of resources needed to create, control and study just a single event are staggering, but the payoff make it profitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_super_computer_q_1;Super Computer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_super_computer_q_1_desc;Humans are by their very nature as a naturally evolved species, inefficient.  Turning over control of much of the low level functions of society to computers both greatly increases efficiency and speeds the transfer of knowledge by freeing up people's time to spend on recreation and improving their knowledge.  During wartime, supercomputers can be repurposed to supply combat drones with much greater battlefield awareness and improved tactics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_super_computer_q_2;Super Computer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_super_computer_q_2_desc;There are a vast amount of small electronic devices with computing power that spend most of it idle. We've integrated them with the supercomputer allowing subsidiary programs to be offloaded and boosting the amount of processing power we can eek out from the mainframe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_super_computer_q_3;Super Computer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_super_computer_q_3_desc;Heating issues puts a limit to the size we can normally expand the supercomputer servers, but with a new coolant system allows us to upscale the current model. Incredibly energy intensive because it both siphons off phenomenal amounts of heat and insures the temperate of the servers stays constant, the cost is justified by the increase in capability and efficiency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_super_computer_q_4;Super Computer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tp_super_computer_q_4_desc;Specialized physical hardware is more efficient for specific tasks then the generic servers so we've for new servers to be designed for a specific task by the supercomputer, fabricated on site and slotted in. Processing power is improved and the computing hub is now a constant whirlwind of activity. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
