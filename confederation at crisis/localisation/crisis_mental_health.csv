EVTDESCBATTLE100;Laser fire rakes across the stars. All around you, ships burn, the void glowing with silent fires. You think your skinsuit might have lost pressure, but you can't be sure, not in the haunting emptiness. Somewhere, deep inside, you can't help but wonder what difference it makes whether you're alive or dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTABATTLE100;I need to get out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBBATTLE100;No, please, not again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCBATTLE100;I can't take this anymore!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCMENTALHEALTH100;You stop in the middle of the corridor. You think you might have been holding something, but whatever it was, it's gone now. You aren't sure how, but suddenly, you're back with your most horrible memory. The skies afire, the screams, the absolute certainty of death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAMENTALHEALTH100;Make it stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
